# Introduction to Ditto SDK - Your First Ditto App ðŸš€

> [!NOTE] 
>This is a proof of concept for the Introduction to Ditto Learning Module.  It is a simple project and task management app that uses Ditto to store and sync the project and task data.  The code provided is not production ready and is only meant to be used as a reference for the POC of Ditto University learning modules. 

## Prerequisites

The Introduction to Ditto Learning Module is provided in several different languages and platforms.  You will need various tools installed based on the platform you are building with.  

You will need the following installed on your development machine to complete this learning module:

### iOS Swift Development Environment
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) 15 or greater
- Git installed on your machine 

### Android Kotlin Development Environment
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) 2024.1.1 or higher (Koala)
- Git installed on your machine 

### Flutter Development Environment
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) 3.19 or greater (Tested with 3.24)
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) 15 or greater
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) 2024.1.1 or higher (Koala)
- An IDE for your choice of language that supports Flutter (Android Studio, VSCode, etc.)
- Git installed on your machine 

## The Scenario

You've just joined a development team for the company Acmezon that recently demonstrated a Project Management app to company leadership. The app demo was a hit - the UI was polished, the interactions were smooth, and leadership was ready to ship it immediately. There was just one catch: the entire app was running on mock data.

The prototype lacks several critical features modern users expect:
- No offline support - data disappears when the app closes
- No data persistence - changes aren't saved between sessions
- No synchronization - changes don't sync between devices
- No real-time updates - users don't see each other's changes

Rather than rebuilding from scratch, the team has decided to integrate Ditto to add these essential features. Your mission is to transform this prototype into a production-ready application with robust offline-first capabilities and peer-to-peer synchronization, all while maintaining the existing user experience.

## Learning Objectives

Through this module, you'll learn how to:
1. What Ditto is and how it works
2. Setup a Ditto Portal account and create an app
3. Replace mock data with a real Ditto database
4. Implement offline-first data persistence
5. Enable real-time updates across devices
