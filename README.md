# Ditto University POC

> [!NOTE] 
>This is a proof of concept for the Ditto University learning modules.  The concepts and code provided is not production ready and is only meant to be used as a reference for the POC of Ditto University learning modules. 

## Welcome to Ditto University

This is a training course for **both internal and external** parties to learn about Ditto.

## Target Audience

The content is targeted at a mobile developer with some experience of building apps that is *completely new* to Ditto. We assume they will have familiarity with:

- One or more mobile development languages / frameworks (e.g. Swift, Kotlin, Flutter etc).
- The software development environment and IDE (e.g. XCode / Android Studio)
- Composing basic UI elements (screens, buttons, lists etc)
- Installation of their application onto a simulator or development device
- Package management and installation of external dependencies

*Note: Whilst Ditto University will touch on all of the above, it is NOT designed to specifically teach any of these elements.*

## Target Outcome

The intention is to convert the mobile developer who was completely new to Ditto into one that can create robust, sophisticated Enterprise production apps using Ditto. They will become deeply familiar with Ditto's core concepts and feel confident in delivering brand new applications into production or migrating existing applications into a more resilient, Ditto-powered form.

## Course Structure

The course material will be deliberately practical with an explicit intention to make progress quickly. It will follow a gradient, starting with basic concepts and a very simple implementation. It will then build on this foundation by introducing more complex topics throughout the course cumulating in a fully-fledged production-ready application. The application's business logic and aesthetics will be kept to an absolute minimum so as not to dilute the purpose away from Ditto-related education.

Modules will roughly be split into Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced Levels. Whilst there will be a linear "start to finish" path, the modules will be sufficiently discrete so that specific topics can be undertaken in isolation.
