# Introduction to Distributed Apps & Ditto ðŸš€

> [!NOTE] 
>This is a proof of concept for the Introduction to Distributed Apps & Ditto.  The code provided is not production ready and is only meant to be used as a reference for the POC of Ditto University learning modules. 

## ðŸŽ“Â Learning outcomes:

 - Understand the shift from RPC to Subscribe-Observe-Query
 - Initial Ditto SDK integration and setup

 ## ðŸŽ¯Â Objectives

 After completing this module, learners will be able to:

- Understand the shift from centralized (RPC-based) to distributed (Subscribe-Observe-Query) paradigms.
- Grasp causal consistency, and understand its practical implications.
- Clearly articulate how Ditto abstracts the complexity of distributed systems (including conflict resolutions via CRDTs) to enable developers to focus on application logic.
- Understand how to successfully integrate Ditto SDK into an existing app (Tasks app).
