# Introduction to Ditto SDK - Your First Ditto App ðŸš€

> [!NOTE] 
>This is a proof of concept for the Introduction to Ditto Learning Module.  It is a simple project and task management app that uses Ditto to store and sync the project and task data.  The code provided is not production ready and is only meant to be used as a reference for the POC of Ditto University learning modules. 


### Application Overview


### The Big Peer and Cloud Storage

The `Big Peer` is a trusted cloud deployment of Ditto's sync engine and associated services that enables advanced platform capabilities. Every Ditto Portal account includes a Big Peer instance that serves as a central hub for data storage and synchronization.

In our Tasks app, data is stored in a collection called `tasks` within the Big Peer instance. Each task is stored as a JSON document in this collection. The Ditto SDK provides a unified API for:
- Reading and writing data to the Big Peer
- Synchronizing with other devices (called `Small Peers`) running the same app
- Managing offline data persistence
- Handling real-time updates

This architecture enables seamless data synchronization between:
- Your device and the cloud (Big Peer)
- Your device and other users' devices (Small Peers)
- The cloud and all connected devices
