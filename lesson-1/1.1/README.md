# 1.1 - Register Your Account ðŸš€

> [!NOTE] 
>This is a proof of concept for the Ditto iOS Introduction to Ditto Learning Module.  It is a simple to-do list app that uses Ditto to store and sync the task data.  This is not production ready code and is only meant to be used as a reference for the POC of Ditto University learning modules. 


### Ditto Portal Account

To use this project, you'll need a Ditto Portal account so we can sync information to the Big Peer and an application configured in the portal to authenticate our app using the Ditto SDK. Here's how to get started:

1. Create a Ditto Portal account at [portal.ditto.live](https://portal.ditto.live/) if you don't have one already. Follow the [account creation guide](https://docs.ditto.live/cloud/portal/creating-a-ditto-account) for detailed instructions.

2. Create a new application in the Ditto Portal. You'll need the app's ID and online playground token for this project. See the [creating a new app guide](https://docs.ditto.live/cloud/portal/creating-a-new-app) for step-by-step instructions.

These credentials (app ID and online playground token) will be used to authenticate your application with Ditto's services.  

## TODO
* Quick explore and orientation of the Portal
* More treatement of Auth, Playground Tokens and App IDs

## Next Steps
Now you have your account registered, you're ready to start building your app. Let's Go!
